This block lets us add image files using their URL instead of uploading files into the Media Library.

This block replaces the Gutenberg's one so that self embeds can also be included.

## GitHub Release

This dynamic block will display a Plugin card on your front-end. A link to the 'WordPress ready' zip package of the plugin release will be included (`plugin-name.zip`).
